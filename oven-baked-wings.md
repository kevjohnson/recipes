https://www.seriouseats.com/recipes/2010/02/the-best-buffalo-wings-oven-fried-wings-recipe.html

### Ingredients (makes 1 serving)
* 1 lb. chicken wings
* 1 teaspoon baking powder
* 1 teaspoon salt
* 2 tablespoons butter
* 2 tablespoons hot sauce (Frank's)

### Instructions
1. Toss wings with baking soda and salt. Place on wire rack and put in fridge for 0-24 hours (at least 8 is best).
2. Bake at **450** for **20 minutes**, flip wings, bake for another **20-30 minutes**.
3. Whisk butter and hot sauce over medium heat.
4. Toss wings in sauce immediately after removing from the oven.

### Notes
* This recipe will likely produce smoke.
* Wings will stick.  Parchment paper works well, but a wire rack sprayed very liberally with PAM is best.  You really want to avoid sticking since it rips the skin off and that's the best part.
* If you don't feel like measuring, be careful on the salt.  Extra baking powder doesn't seem to produce noticeable negative effects, but too much salt can be a problem.
* Skipping the fridge will still produce pretty good wings, but they won't be as crispy.  It's still worth it to toss in baking soda even if you're skipping the fridge.
